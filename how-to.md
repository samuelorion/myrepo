## How to ... 

#### add a gif to a .md 

- make a recording ?how
- convert to gif ?how
- host it somehwere (here, it's in the repo, loose) 
- write the following

```
![a gif / an image](image location)
```
Note , if the file is is the root, you can just give the file name. 

```

![a gif](my_gif.gif)
```

![a gif in the readme](my_gif.gif)

But, if it's somehwere else, this won't work.  
![an image](dotchart-1.png)  

You need to get the "https:address", such as : 
```
![an image](https://github.com/samuelorion/myrepo/blob/master/Untitled_files/figure-gfm/dotchart-1.png)
```
![an image](https://github.com/samuelorion/myrepo/blob/master/Untitled_files/figure-gfm/dotchart-1.png)
